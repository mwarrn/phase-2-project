    <p>
      This application was built for Amazon Fresh Online Site Leadership (Site Lead, Area Managers, and Assistant Managers) to
      track performance and identify any potential trends using a collection of data entered by Assistant Managers at the end of
      shift. This data is currently available through other third-party tools, but the heavy overhead involved in accessing such
      data often makes it difficult for Site Leadership to make quick, effective, and accurate decisions. This data also conflicts
      at times with data collected day of from AFTLite Labor Summary and other dashboards. Identifying performance trends is crucial
      for meeting and exceeding customer facing metrics (Late SLAM and Late Batch) to maintain an excellent customer experience. 
      Tracking these metrics also helps Site Leadership deep-dive any potential challenges and barriers Outbound Assistant Managers 
      may be encountering with running a successful shift.
